//SKILLS
$JS_p1="First contact with JS was during my front-end certification in San Diego, same for jQuery. But it was while freelancing in November of 2017, during my first job in Vollup Creative Agency, that I realized how unprepared to read and write JS I was, while facing trivial needs that I couldn't get done.";
$JS_p2="After this period, I decided to take as much time I need to get fluency in JS before try to find any other job opportunity. Then I started to attend a serie of short Udemy's courses, mostly with the Canadian Laurence Svekis, totalizing 11 course-hours in 6 certifications.";
$JS_p3="But it was in March of 2018 that I online met former students of the Brazilian prof. Fernando Daciuk and got convinced that I should buy this 42-hour-course of Vanilla JS. Showing a very special method and well developed challenges, I finally started to feel indeed a programmer.";
$JS_p4="However, I still have a long way to go. I'm still not using the most advanced features from latest versions of EcmaScript and still writting my code in a functional programming way, not object oriented. But pretty soon I want to study these things and move my code to the next level.";

$PHP_p1="While developing the first version of my own website, in 2017, I had to do a little PHP research in order to figure out how to program it's contact form. In short courses that I made this time, I could learn also how to program a dual-language website, and dinamyc pages using arrays to store objects.";
$PHP_p2="Despite replicating a few of those methods at Ginger's website, only working at the Brindes' website maintenance - during my second season in Vollup, March of 2019, that I could face legacy php code with a very challenging complexity to my level. Some effort and nice coworkers helped me to accomplish our client's needs, including new logic rules in the search in a mySQL data-base.";
$PHP_p3="In June of 2019, I had a chance to attend a 50-hours-course by SoftBLue. After this period I started to develop the third version of my website, looking for to implement some of the recent PHP learnings. Soon, I'll use PHP to build a custom CMS of Heloisa Aquarela's website, connected to a mySQL data-base.";
$PHP_p4="So far, I took almost 70 hours in certifications, but I'm still considering myself a beginner in this language.";

$CSS_p1="Cascade Style Sheets always were part of the front-end certification that I got in San Diego, already from it's version 3, so I couldn't tell which features belong to the earlier versions.";
$CSS_p2="My biggest hard time with CSS always were how to get a perfect grid, also how to have a perfect control of the hidden margins defined by natively by the browsers. But all my issues always were solved with fast searches on the web and, more important, the FLexBox's advent was a turning point to me.";
$CSS_p3="I'm not sure if I can say my knowledge is advanced, but sometimes I may use fancy stuff, since I'm always comfortable doing new searches to find something more pretty and quickly implement something new in my code.";
$CSS_p4="Sinec I recognize a deficit more in other technologies - not CSS - I feel comfortable to focus my free time on them, quite satisfied with my CSS level.";

$HTML_p1="As CSS, my first contact with HTML was also during my front-end certification and, likewise, it was already in it's latest version, the HTML5.";

$HTML_p2="When you use a technology so often and getting everything you actually need, it becomes hard to tell if your level is advanced or just that intermediary when you extract from it every need you may have. In my case, I had a more meaningful learnign when I got how to use HTML4 tables, in order to code email marketing, than any other need that I may had over my most compelx projects.";
$HTML_p3="But, yes, anytime I try to make sure that I already know the best practices in a HTML code and, in sometimes, I make my search to get a better understanding of how some tags and attributes may work.";
$HTML_p4="In general I always use semantic tags, like 'main', 'section', 'article', 'button', 'header', and 'footer', and it's been for a while since I saw last time any unknown tag while reading someone else's code.";

$Bootstrap_p1="First contact with Bootstrap was during my front-end certification in San Diego. Our final project by the way was to build a CSS framework, which I had done with 3 other classmates.";
$Bootstrap_p2="But the first professional experience was in November of 2017, at Vollup Creative Agency, dealing with multiple projects - most of them based in a Bootstrap framework.";
$Bootstrap_p3="I also accomplished a Bootstrap 4 course at Udemy platform, with the Canadian Brad Hussey, but nowadays I feel more like using Bulma.css, which is a flex-box based workframe, more fluid and responsive.";
$Bootstrap_p4="However, my steps in css frameworks are more defined by my bosses than my own will, since I feel like using my free time more in programming languages than style sheets.";

$Vtex_p1="3 months working in 2 projects with Vtex Ecommerce: before the release of Mari Maria Makeup and on maintenance of Wolff Café.";
$Vtex_p2="Tasks included ajustments like customization of templates, editing CSS and Javascript, changing layouts as the client demanded, managing the store controling it's products, promotions and including extra itens in the signature club.";
$Vtex_p3="By the end of this period of 3 months I was starting to get a little deep into the Meta Data section of Vtex, creating data fields and filling them manually or automatically by the Vtex API, like storing pictures from the Instagram account of the client.";

$SCSS_p1="Sassy CSS was introduced to me also in the front-end certification. I love the nesting structure that helps me to have a better organization of my code, also using variables, mixins, and media query includes.";
$SCSS_p2="But I'm aware that so far my use didn't try to take benefit of functions. I actually never needed it, so I'm not sure when I will get into that. But for sure it seems to be a very fancy feature of this compiler and at one point my curiosity will lead me to learn a bit of those functions.";

$Reactjs_p1="Accomplished in July 2020 an important 91-hour course in React.js, with my favorite professor Fernando Daciuk.";
$Reactjs_p2="These last learning months taught me how to use Redux, Context API, React Hooks, React Router, Higher-Order Components, Styled Components, Wepback, Component Lifecycle, as well as all the fundamentals of the library from its emergence to the most recent versions (v16), in addition to providing me with a considerable update for EcmaScript 6.";
$Reactjs_p3="Today I feel completely in love with this technology and my biggest dream is to work with it for a long time.";
